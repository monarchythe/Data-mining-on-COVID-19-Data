# Data-mining-on-COVID-19-Data
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data provided by Google Cloud Platform, which includes information on the spread of the virus, demographics, and social distancing efforts in the United States. The goal is to understand trends, assess the effectiveness of social distancing, and predict future developments in various regions.
We are using **CRISP-DM** model to do our Data Analysis, starting with the Business Understanding as well as  Data Understanding

## Step 1: Business Understanding
This involves defining the problem and understanding the significance of the data for COVID-19. Here's a draft that you can build upon:

**COVID-19 Overview:**

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. It is essential to understand how the virus spreads, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in various regions, and the impact of social distancing.
Social distancing: We are aware thats its a key method to slow the spread of the virus by reducing close contact between people. But we want to explore how effective this method was in terms of flattening the curve.

**Reason to Analyze COVID-19 Data**

Policymakers, healthcare institutions, and researchers are interested in data to understand the spread, manage healthcare resources, and devise strategies (like lockdowns) to reduce transmission rates.
By analyzing trends in infection rates, hospitalizations, and social distancing measures, we can help predict future outbreaks, identify regions that have controlled the virus effectively, and inform decision-making.
Key Decisions Informed by This Data:

Healthcare resource allocation: Where to send more resources (hospitals, ventilators).
Policy decisions: Determining when to implement or ease restrictions based on the success of social distancing measures.
Public communication: Informing the public about infection trends and the importance of social distancing.

## Step 2: Data Understanding

**Understanding the Data:**
1. Loading and inspection of the datasets.
2. Identifying important variables: cases, deaths, population, hospital resources, and social distancing measures.

**Verifying Data Quality:**
Checking for missing values, duplicates, and outliers and handling them.

**Descriptive Statistics:**
Analyzing through statistics like mean, median, mode, range, and variance for important variables.

**Visualize Key Attributes:**
Explore trends across states and counties thrugh visualizaion methods
